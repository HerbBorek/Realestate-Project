Exploratory Statistical Analysis – Using Excel

This originated as a project in a Statistics course I took while earning my Masters’ in Business Data Analytics. 
It illustrates a “bag of tricks” I often use when examining a new dataset, and a way of summarizing the results. 
The Excel workbook provided reflects the data considered (single-family home values in three zip codes in West County St. Louis) 
and my analysis. The first four tabs reflect the data, the tabs beginning with “D” (D1, D2 etc.) 
reflect descriptive statistics, those beginning with “I” reflect inferential statistics and those beginning with M 
pertain to regression analysis.

Getting Started

If necessary, install Excel. Version 16.3 will be most compatible with my spreadsheet, but subsequent versions are 
likely to work as well. Download the spreadsheet, and save two copies with different names.  
(Perhaps “Analysis Template” and “Exploring My Data.”) Create new tabs for each of your datasets in “Exploring My Data,” 
and add the data.

Analyzing Your Data

Review tabs D1 through D3, and identify fields for which the mean, median and/or standard deviation will be of interest.  
Study the Excel formulas used to create these measures and apply them to your data.  Review tab D4 and use the techniques 
shown to create counts, percentages and pie charts.
Review tab I1 and identify fields for which confidence intervals for the mean will be of interest.  Study the formulas and 
apply them to your data. Review tab I2 and identify fields reflecting a qualitative characteristic for which confidence 
intervals for the proportion of data with that characteristic will be of interest. Study the Excel formulas used to create 
those measures and apply them to your data.

Review tabs I3 and I4 and identify fields for which the results of a hypothesis test of two or more means 
would be of interest.  Study the formulas and apply them to your data.

Select an important dependant variables to study and one or more potentially predictor variables. 
Run regressions for single predictors to create reports as in M1, and then try combinations of two predictors as in M2.
